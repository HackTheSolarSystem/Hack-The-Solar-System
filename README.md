<h2>Solution</h2>
<p> Our solution to teaching the solar system was to make an interactive solar system where a user can manipulate a planets distance from the sun. This will arbitrarily show how depending on the distance, the orbital speed is affected. A user can also change the mass and show how it affects the planets gravity with respect to itself ie show the new gravitational force. We took a simplified user focused approach to show that as you approach closer to the sun the speed or orbit increases. The problems we ran into during this was implementing a more calculus-physics based approach which will actually show collisions and the multi-body mass equations to show how each planet would be affected if a mass of a planet is much larger than Jupiter or the Sun. In the future we would like to take on the more calculus based approach and show the multi-body approach.
